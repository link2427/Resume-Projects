# My Resume Projects
This repository showcases some of my programming projects that I have worked on. Below is a brief description of each project.

# RaidVoice
RaidVoice is a Python program designed to assist players of Escape from Tarkov in determining the current market price of in-game items. The program utilizes text-to-speech technology to facilitate the retrieval of pricing information by using a user-specified hotkey and verbal command for the requested item.

# LINKBot
LINKBot is a versatile Discord bot written in Python with a wide range of capabilities, including voice generation, image recognition, Tarkov item prices, weather information, dice and coin flipping, and stock prices. Itâ€™s easy to use and adds value to any Discord community.

# Hockey Statistics
Hockey Statistics is a C++ program tackling data manipulation and storage utilizing a binary search tree. The program is capable of storing, organizing, and computing player data. The program also flawlessly and efficiently handles input, which is processed into an easy-to-read output and copied to a file, making it easy for the user to read their data.

Each project has its own folder within the repository containing the source code, any necessary dependencies, and instructions on how to run the program.

I am continuously working on improving and adding new features to these projects. Feel free to check them out and let me know your thoughts!
